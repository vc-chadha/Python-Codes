# Python-Codes
This repository consists of various basic codes based on Python Programming

About the Programs :
- ' Basic Binary Input Program ' : Using this program you can input basic details in your byte mode and save data in the form of Binary Files .
- ' TO READ .txt Files ' : Using this program you can perform READ function on the already stored .txt file on your pc .
- ' STACK BASIC FINAL ' : You can input elements and perform all PUSH/POP/READ on each of the elements avaialble . Use 'Yes' to continue to code loop & 'No' to end the code loop .
- ' Avg from user ' : Input total number of elements you want to perform this operation upon . Then simply input those elements for the output .

  For Example :
  source code                      --> C:\\'enter_your_path_address_here'\\'enter_file_name_here'.csv)
  what your code should look alike --> C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Desktop\\BookRecord.csv)
